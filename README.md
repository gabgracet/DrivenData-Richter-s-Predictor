The aim of this project is to predict building damage grades caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal using the dataset provided by the Richter's Predictor competition hosted by DrivenData. The project involves preprocessing the data, feature engineering, and building predictive models using machine learning techniques such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance with an F1 Score of 0.7488, ranking in the top 17.45% of participants.
